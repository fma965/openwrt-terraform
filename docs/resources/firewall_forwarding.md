# openwrt_firewall_forwarding (Resource)

Firewall zone rules for controlling flow between zones.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "openwrt_firewall_zone" "wan" {
  id       = "wantest"
  name     = "wan"
  forward  = "REJECT"
  input    = "REJECT"
  output   = "ACCEPT"
  network = [
    "wan"
  ]
}

resource "openwrt_firewall_zone" "lan" {
  id       = "lantest"
  name     = "lan"
  forward  = "ACCEPT"
  input    = "ACCEPT"
  output   = "ACCEPT"
  network = [
    "lan"
  ]
}

resource "openwrt_firewall_forwarding" "this" {
  id   = "testing"
  src  = "lan"
  dest = "wan"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `dest` (String) zone dest
- `src` (String) zone src

### Optional

- `family` (String) Applies the rule to specific protocol families. Defaults to automatically determining which family if unset.
- `id` (String) Name of the section. This name is only used when interacting with UCI directly.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Find the Terraform id from LuCI's JSON-RPC API.
# One way to find this information is with `curl` and `jq`:
#
# curl \
#     --data '{"id": 0, "method": "foreach", "params": ["firewall", "forwarding"]}' \
#     http://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/luci/rpc/uci?auth=$AUTH_TOKEN \
#     | jq '.result | map({terraformId: .[".name"]})'
#
# This command will output something like:
#
# [
#   {
#     "terraformId": "cfg123456",
#   }
# ]
#
# We'd then use the information to import the appropriate resource:

terraform import openwrt_firewall_forwarding.this cfg123456
```
