# openwrt_firewall_redirect (Resource)

Firewall traffic port forwarding redirects allowing traffic intended for a port on the currnent host to be sent to a port on a different host.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "openwrt_firewall_zone" "wan" {
  id       = "wantest"
  name     = "wan"
  forward  = "REJECT"
  input    = "REJECT"
  output   = "ACCEPT"
  network = [
    "wan"
  ]
}

resource "openwrt_firewall_zone" "lan" {
  id       = "lantest"
  name     = "lan"
  forward  = "ACCEPT"
  input    = "ACCEPT"
  output   = "ACCEPT"
  network = [
    "lan"
  ]
}

resource "openwrt_firewall_redirect" "this" {
  id       = "testing"
  name     = "example-rule"
  src      = openwrt_firewall_zone.wan.name
  src_dport = 8080
  dest      = openwrt_firewall_zone.lan.name
  dest_port = 8080
  dest_ip = [
    "192.168.0.0"
  ]
  target = "DNAT"
  family = "ipv4"
  proto = [
    "tcp",
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `dest` (String) Rule applies to traffic entering this zone
- `dest_ip` (List of String) Rule applies to traffic targetting these IP addresses.
- `dest_port` (Number) Rule applies to traffic targetting this port
- `name` (String) Human readable rule name.
- `proto` (List of String) List of protocols this rule applies to, currently only supports "tcp" and "udp"
- `src` (String) Rule applies to traffic from this zone
- `target` (String) NAT target, must be either "DNAT" or "SNAT"

### Optional

- `family` (String) Applies the rule to specific protocol families. Defaults to automatically determining which family if unset.
- `id` (String) Name of the section. This name is only used when interacting with UCI directly.
- `src_dip` (List of String) Rule applies to traffic originating from any of these IP addresses.
- `src_dport` (Number) Rule applies to traffic targetting this port
- `src_ip` (List of String) Rule applies to traffic originating from any of these IP addresses.
- `src_port` (Number) Rule applies to traffic originating from this port

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Find the Terraform id from LuCI's JSON-RPC API.
# One way to find this information is with `curl` and `jq`:
#
# curl \
#     --data '{"id": 0, "method": "foreach", "params": ["firewall", "redirect"]}' \
#     http://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/luci/rpc/uci?auth=$AUTH_TOKEN \
#     | jq '.result | map({terraformId: .[".name"]})'
#
# This command will output something like:
#
# [
#   {
#     "terraformId": "cfg123456",
#   }
# ]
#
# We'd then use the information to import the appropriate resource:

terraform import openwrt_firewall_redirect.this cfg123456
```
